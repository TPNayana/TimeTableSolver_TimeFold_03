Replace the current scheduling implementation (greedy/backtracking) with a backend integration that uses Timefold as an external solver service.

What to do

Remove the existing greedy/backtracking scheduling logic from server/scheduler.ts and stop using it in /api/schedule/generate.

Create a new solver client (e.g. server/timefoldClient.ts) that sends the scheduling data to a Timefold Java backend service and receives the optimized schedule in response.

The Timefold service will be based on:
https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts.git (school-timetabling example)

Assume the Timefold Java solver exposes an endpoint:
POST http://localhost:8080/api/schedule/solve

Request payload format to send from Node backend to Timefold:
{
  "timeslots": [
    {
      "id": "MON_08",
      "dayOfWeek": "MONDAY",
      "startTime": "08:00",
      "endTime": "09:00"
    }
  ],
  "lessons": [
    {
      "id": "L1",
      "subject": "DBMS",
      "teacher": "Suraj",
      "studentGroup": "CSE A",
      "department": "CSE",
      "timeslotId": null
    }
  ]
}

Response payload format expected from Timefold:
{
  "lessons": [
    {
      "id": "L1",
      "subject": "DBMS",
      "teacher": "Suraj",
      "studentGroup": "CSE A",
      "department": "CSE",
      "timeslotId": "MON_08"
    }
  ]
}

Update the API route

Modify /api/schedule/generate so that:

It calls the new timefoldClient.solveSchedule() instead of the greedy scheduler

Maps the returned lessons back to the frontend format

Returns the solved timetable to the React UI

Constraints to enforce on the Timefold side

A teacher cannot teach two classes in the same timeslot

A student group cannot attend two classes in the same timeslot

No overlapping classes in the same day/time slot

Monday–Friday, 08:00 AM–05:00 PM (1-hour slots)

Frontend expectations

No UI changes required, existing filters, AM/PM display, and interactions must stay working

Only the backend solver changes

Show loading state while waiting for solver results

Deliverable

Remove the local algorithms and integrate Timefold as the scheduling engine by replacing the logic in /api/schedule/generate with calls to the Timefold solver service via HTTP using timefoldClient.ts.
