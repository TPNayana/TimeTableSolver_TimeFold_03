Replace the existing custom scheduling implementation (Greedy / Backtracking) with Timefold as the backend solver. Timefold must generate the optimized timetable schedule based on the constraints and return the solved schedule to the frontend.

Requirements

Remove the existing Greedy and Backtracking scheduling logic completely.

Integrate Timefold using the backend architecture demonstrated in:
https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts.git
Use the school timetabling quickstart as the base reference for required entities, planning variables, constraints, and solver configuration.

Implement Timefold as the solver service so that:

The frontend sends scheduling input data (from uploaded Excel or demo dataset).

Timefold processes the schedule and applies constraints.

The optimized schedule is returned to the frontend as JSON for rendering in the timetable UI.

Data Handling

Input dataset: extracted from uploaded Excel (or demo dataset if no Excel uploaded yet).

Pass timetable items to Timefold in the required planning format.

Output should include the assigned timeslots for each class.

Constraints (must be enforced by Timefold)

A teacher cannot teach more than one class at the same time.

A student group cannot attend two classes at the same time.

Classes must not overlap within the same day/time slot.

Time slots Monday–Friday, 08:00 AM–05:00 PM (1 hour per slot).

Communication Layer

Implement an endpoint to send initial problem data to Timefold.

Implement an endpoint to receive the optimized solution.

Ensure the frontend updates the calendar view when a solution is returned.

Expected Output

Timefold produces a conflict-free schedule.

The frontend renders the final timetable with AM/PM display.

Filters continue to operate client-side on the solved schedule.

Deliverable

Replace existing solver implementation with a Timefold-backed scheduling service using the Timefold quickstart repository as the foundation, ensuring a functional end-to-end solved timetable output.
